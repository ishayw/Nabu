 |      never_drop_input=None,
 |      prime_output_buffers_using_stream_callback=None
 |  )
 |      PortAudio input stream (using NumPy).
 |
 |      This has the same methods and attributes as `Stream`, except
 |      `~Stream.write()` and `~Stream.write_available`.
 |      Furthermore, the stream callback is expected to have a different
 |      signature (see below).
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      callback : callable
 |          User-supplied function to consume audio in response to
 |          requests from an active stream.
 |          The callback must have this signature:
 |
 |          .. code-block:: text
 |
 |              callback(indata: numpy.ndarray, frames: int,
 |                       time: CData, status: CallbackFlags) -> None
 |
 |          The arguments are the same as in the *callback* parameter of
 |          `Stream`, except that *outdata* is missing.
 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      Stream, RawInputStream
 |
 |  read(self, frames)
 |      Read samples from the stream into a NumPy array.
 |
 |      The function doesn't return until all requested *frames* have
 |      been read -- this may involve waiting for the operating system
 |      to supply the data (except if no more than `read_available`
 |      frames were requested).
 |
 |      This is the same as `RawStream.read()`, except that it
 |      returns a NumPy array instead of a plain Python buffer object.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      frames : int
 |          The number of frames to be read.  This parameter is not
 |          constrained to a specific range, however high performance
 |          applications will want to match this parameter to the
 |          *blocksize* parameter used when opening the stream.
 |
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      data : numpy.ndarray
 |          A two-dimensional `numpy.ndarray` with one column per
 |          channel (i.e.  with a shape of ``(frames, channels)``) and
 |          with a data type specified by `dtype`.
 |      overflowed : bool
 |          ``True`` if input data was discarded by PortAudio after the
 |          previous call and before this call.
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Readonly properties inherited from _InputStreamBase:
 |
 |  read_available
 |      The number of frames that can be read without waiting.
 |
 |      Returns a value representing the maximum number of frames that
 |      can be read from the stream without blocking or busy waiting.
 |

 |  Methods inherited from _StreamBase:
 |
 |  __enter__(self)
 |      Start  the stream in the beginning of a "with" statement.
 |
 |  __exit__(self, *args)
 |      Stop and close the stream when exiting a "with" statement.
 |
 |  abort(self, ignore_errors=True)
 |      Terminate audio processing immediately.
 |
 |      This does not wait for pending buffers to complete.
 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      start, stop
 |
 |  close(self, ignore_errors=True)
 |      Close the stream.
 |
 |      If the audio stream is active any pending buffers are discarded
 |      as if `abort()` had been called.
 |
 |  start(self)
 |      Commence audio processing.
 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      stop, abort
 |
 |  stop(self, ignore_errors=True)
 |      Terminate audio processing.
 |
 |      This waits until all pending audio buffers have been played
 |      before it returns.
 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      start, abort
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Readonly properties inherited from _StreamBase:
 |
 |  active
 |      ``True`` when the stream is active, ``False`` otherwise.
 |
 |      A stream is active after a successful call to `start()`, until
 |      it becomes inactive either as a result of a call to `stop()` or
 |      `abort()`, or as a result of an exception raised in the stream
 |      callback.  In the latter case, the stream is considered inactive
 |      after the last buffer has finished playing.
 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      stopped
 |
 |  blocksize
 |      Number of frames per block.
 |
 |      The special value 0 means that the blocksize can change between
 |      blocks.  See the *blocksize* argument of `Stream`.
 |
 |  channels
 |      The number of input/output channels.
 |
 |  closed
 |      ``True`` after a call to `close()`, ``False`` otherwise.
 |
 |  cpu_load
 |      CPU usage information for the stream.
 |
 |      The "CPU Load" is a fraction of total CPU time consumed by a
 |      callback stream's audio processing routines including, but not
 |      limited to the client supplied stream callback. This function
 |      does not work with blocking read/write streams.
 |
 |      This may be used in the stream callback function or in the
 |      application.
 |      It provides a floating point value, typically between 0.0 and
 |      1.0, where 1.0 indicates that the stream callback is consuming
 |      the maximum number of CPU cycles possible to maintain real-time
 |      operation.  A value of 0.5 would imply that PortAudio and the
 |      stream callback was consuming roughly 50% of the available CPU
 |      time.  The value may exceed 1.0.  A value of 0.0 will always be
 |      returned for a blocking read/write stream, or if an error
 |      occurs.
 |
 |  device
 |      IDs of the input/output device.
 |
 |  dtype
 |      Data type of the audio samples.
 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      default.dtype, samplesize
 |
 |  latency
 |      The input/output latency of the stream in seconds.
 |
 |      This value provides the most accurate estimate of input/output
 |      latency available to the implementation.
 |      It may differ significantly from the *latency* value(s) passed
 |      to `Stream()`.
 |
 |  samplerate
 |      The sampling frequency in Hertz (= frames per second).
 |
 |      In cases where the hardware sampling frequency is inaccurate and
 |      PortAudio is aware of it, the value of this field may be
 |      different from the *samplerate* parameter passed to `Stream()`.
 |      If information about the actual hardware sampling frequency is
 |      not available, this field will have the same value as the
 |      *samplerate* parameter passed to `Stream()`.
 |
 |  samplesize
 |      The size in bytes of a single sample.
 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      dtype
 |
 |  stopped
 |      ``True`` when the stream is stopped, ``False`` otherwise.
 |
 |      A stream is considered to be stopped prior to a successful call
 |      to `start()` and after a successful call to `stop()` or
 |      `abort()`.  If a stream callback is cancelled (by raising an
 |      exception) the stream is *not* considered to be stopped.
 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      active
 |
 |  time
 |      The current stream time in seconds.
 |
 |      This is according to the same clock used to generate the
 |      timestamps passed with the *time* argument to the stream
 |      callback (see the *callback* argument of `Stream`).
 |      The time values are monotonically increasing and have
 |      unspecified origin.
 |
 |      This provides valid time values for the entire life of the
 |      stream, from when the stream is opened until it is closed.
 |      Starting and stopping the stream does not affect the passage of
 |      time as provided here.
 |
 |      This time may be used for synchronizing other events to the
 |      audio stream, for example synchronizing audio to MIDI.
